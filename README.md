EZ PO Purchase Order Generator

This application is a purchase order generator that allows a distributor to order from their manufacturer with ease. 
Everything that is required on the purchase order for the manufacturer is included and the distributor's price is automatically calculated.

The application is created using HTML, CSS, & Vanilla JavaScript and is responsive.  I also used Node as the runtime environment and express to communicate with the backend.  
I used Axios to make client-side requests and the data is sent to a Postgres database using Sequelize.
